# cnnFaceExpr
Learning purpose CNN models. Aim to familiarise myself with Keras and to compare the performance of different nerual architectures.

Dataset used: icml_face_data.csv (renamed as train.csv) from https://www.kaggle.com/debanga/facial-expression-recognition-challenge?select=test.csv
**Dataset would be divided into half for training and testing**
